# Robotino-Wireless-communication
Python code to convert Data in order to transmit them to a robotino wireless server

During ma studeis, I had to work on a Robotino Robot. 
I had to drive it remotely by a python codes.

The robotino documentation was not complete, and I had a hard work to understand how to exchange data between the robotino and python code.

I wrote a kind a report for my school, the "IUT of Mulhouse" (France) you kinf found here (not transtlated) : http://www.projetsgeii.iutmulhouse.uha.fr/nao-robot-daccueil-du-cfau/#Lerob

Because I uploaded video, a lot* of new students wrote me to have my codes and some explanations.
My code was horrible and for python 2.7 (I indexed array with float. Shame on me).

So I decided to refactor a part of my code, 4 years ago.
It is this project

_\* Ok , 3 students ..._
  
# REMEMBER
This code is not a complete server/client example implementation !
It only demonstrates how to exchange numerical data between Robotino View project and python code.
Feel free to translate it in other language

# HOW TO 
1) Download the "robotino view" project 'WirelessCommunictionExample.rvwx' and open it
   
2) Check the configuration of the serveur in the robotino project (optional)

In the image you can all the mains elements necessary in data exchange : 
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Server Windows
- Menu to add a server to your project

3) Launch the robotino view project

4) Launch the script a 'WirelessCommunictionExample.py' with a Python 3 interpreter

It's all :-)
